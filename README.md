# Shapes API Examples

This repository provides simple example projects demonstrating how to use the Shapes API in both Python and Node.js.

For more details, see [API.md](API.md).

## Overview

- **Shapes API**: Chat completions endpoint powered by shape personalities.
  - Base URL: `https://api.shapes.inc/v1/`
  - Uses meta model `shapesinc/<shape-username>`
  - Premium shapes may consume credits.

- **Shape Voice**: A React.js example of using the Shapes API to talk to your shape.
  - Requires a Deepgram API key for voice recognition
  - Uses in-browser Kokoro TTS for text to speech

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (3.12+), `pip`, and `virtualenv` for the Python examples.
- **Node.js** (18+) and `npm` for the Node.js examples.

## Authentication

All examples require the following API keys set as environment variables
or in .env file (with VITE_ prefix if the example is a Vite project):

```
SHAPESINC_API_KEY=your-shapes-api-key
SHAPESINC_SHAPE_USERNAME=your-shape-username
```

Each example directory includes a `.env.example` you can copy as `.env` and add your keys.
